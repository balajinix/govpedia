Hello there! This is a project maintained by Balaji (thats me, balajinix at gmail) to collect public documents and government related information. It also helps me try out different Information Retrieval software!
<br/>
<br/>
This website has 3 parts.
<br/>
<br/>

1. Search - <a href="http://govpedia.in/search">govpedia.in/search</a> - still under construction.
<br/>
<br/>

This is an installation of <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch.</a>. I considered using <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> and <a href="http://hibernate.org/search/">Hibernate Search</a>. I chose ElasticSearch because its got tailwind, is used by Wikimedia for its search feature, and seems to have a lot better API.

<br/>
<br/>
2. Wiki - <a href="http://govpedia.in/wiki">govpedia.in/wiki</a>
<br/>
<br/>

This is an installation of the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki software</a>.
<br/>
<br/>

3. Share - <a href="http://govpedia.in/share">govpedia.in/share</a>
<br/>
<br/>

This is an installation of <a href="http://pligg.com/">Pligg</a>. Its works similar to <a href="digg.com">digg.com</a>. I had used this software for rightnews.in and smartvote.in/share, both of which no longer exist.
